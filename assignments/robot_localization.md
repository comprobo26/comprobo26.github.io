## Abstract

So far, we've programmed Neatos using reactive control strategies and combined behaviors using finite state control. As we consider more complex tasks we may want a robot to do, having access to higher-level environment information and decision-making capabilities become critical. We will explore one of the most fundamental problems in robotics (through a lens of mobile robotics) during this project: robot localization.

## Learning Objectives

* Build fluency with ROS2, including being able to read and contribute to a large existing code base
* Learn about one core problem (robot localization) and one important algorithm (particle filtering)
* Learn strategies for developing and debugging algorithms for robotics, including unit test design
* Get a feel for the algorithmic trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency

## Teaming

For this project, you should work with one other student (teams of three are tentatively allowed for this assignment). Once you have formed your team, please [add yourself to Canvas](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1070/groups#tab-1312). At the end of this project, you will [submit an individual reflection](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1070/quizzes/2978) that include teaming experience.  

## Deliverables

### Conceptual Overview (Due Friday October 2 by 7PM)

Using a combination of diagrams and text, describe the major steps of the particle filter at a level of detail sufficient for creating your particle filter implementation.

As you write your conceptual overview, if there is a gap in your understanding that is fine, but be sure to note it, so you can get help in class (or during office hours).

1. What topics will your particle filter subscribe to?  Which topics will it publish?  You can include the specific topic names and types or just indicate generally what the role of each topic will be in the functioning of your particle filter.

2. Your code will be responsible for computing a robot pose, what coordinate frame is the pose expressed in?

3. Given an initial $$x, y, \theta$$ tuple, how will you generate a set of particles?

4. Given two odometry poses sampled at two time points (each represented as $$x, y, \theta$$ tuples), how will you update each of your particles? (make sure to keep in mind what coordinate frame you are working in)

5. Given a laser scan, how will you determine the weight (or confidence) value of each particle?

6. Given a weighted set of particles, how will you determine the robot's pose?

7. Given a weighted set of particles, how will you sample a new set of particles?

8. How will you verify that your code works as intended? What tests will you implement? 

You can submit your assignment [on Canvas](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1070/assignments/20099). Each team can submit one document.

### In-class Presentation / Demo (Due Monday October 19 by Class)

Each team will spend about 5 minutes presenting what they did for this project. Since everyone's doing the same project, there's no need to provide any context as to what the particle filter is or how it works.  I'd like each team to talk about what they did that adds to the overall knowledge of the class.  Examples of this would be non-trivial design decisions you made (and why you made them), development processes that worked particularly well, code architecture, tests you implemented and their performance, etc. In addition, you should show a demo of your system in action.

You can submit your slide(s) and contribute to the class presentation through the [Canvas assignment](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1070/assignments/20103).


### Individual Reflection (Due Tuesday October 20 by 7PM)
Each person will reflect on their project teaming experience and how the experience related to their learning goals. This is a graded survey in [Canvas](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1070/quizzes/2978). You will have up to a week after the project is due to submit your reflection.


### Your Code and Bag Files (Due Tuesday October 20 by 7PM)

If you are using Python (the vast majority of the class), you should fork <a href="https://github.com/comprobo26/robot_localization">this repo</a>.  If you are using C++, you should fork <a href="https://github.com/comprobo26/robot_localization_cpp">this repo</a>.  Please push your code to your fork in order to turn it in.

You should include a couple of bag files of your code in action. Place the bag files in a subdirectory of your ROS package called "bags".  In this folder, create a README file that explains each of the bag files (how they were collected, what you learn from the results, etc.).

Please [submit a link to your fork on Canvas](https://canvas.olin.edu/courses/1070/assignments/20098) when you have prepared your project for final submission (Note: this includes the write-up (details below) as it is part of your repository).

### Writeup (Due Tuesday October 20 by 7PM)

In your ROS package create a ``README.md`` file to hold your project writeup. We expect this writeup to be done in such a way that you are proud to include it as part of your professional portfolio. As such, please make sure to write the report so that it is understandable to an external audience.  Make sure to add pictures to your report, links to Youtube videos, embedded animated Gifs (these can be recorded with the tool ``peek``), and so on.

Your write-up should touch on the following topics. 
* What was the goal of your project?
* How did you solve the problem? (Note: this doesn't have to be super-detailed, you should try to explain what you did at a high-level so that others in the class could reasonably understand what you did).
* Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.
* Describe the tests that you implemented and conducted to verify your code, and their results.
* What if any challenges did you face along the way?
* What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?
* Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.

## Robot Localization and the Particle Filter

For this project you will be programming your robot to answer a question that many of us have pondered ourselves over the course of our lifetimes: "Where am I?". The answer to this question is of fundamental importance to a number of applications in mobile robotics such as mapping and path planning.

For this project, we will assume access to a map of the robot's environment. This map could either be obtained using a mapping algorithm (such as SLAM), derived from building blueprints, or even hand-drawn. Given that we have a map of our environment, we can pose the question of "Where am I?" probabilistically. That is, at each instant in time, $$t$$, we will construct a probability distribution over the robot's pose within the map, denoted as $$x_t$$, given the robot's sensory inputs, denoted as $$z_t$$ (in this case Lidar measurements), and the motor commands sent to the robot at time $$t$$, $$u_t$$.

The particle filter involves the following steps

1. Initialize a set of particles via random sampling
2. Update the particles using data from odometry
3. Reweight the particles based on their compatibility with the laser scan
4. Resample with replacement a new set of particles with probability proportional to their weights.
5. Update your estimate of the robot's pose given the new particles.  Update the ``map`` to ``odom`` transform.

## Starter Code

### Getting the Robot Localizer Starter Code

The starter code will be in a package called ``robot_localization``.  The <a href="https://github.com/comprobo26/robot_localization"><tt>robot_localization</tt> Github repo</a> you forked is already setup as an appropriate package.  Once you clone your fork to your ROS2 workspace, do a ``colcon build --symlink-install`` and source ``install/setup.bash``.

### Installing Supporting Packages

You will need some additional ROS packages that we haven't used thus far.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
pip3 install scikit-learn && sudo apt install -y ros-jazzy-nav2-map-server \
	ros-jazzy-nav2-amcl \
	ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox \
	python3-pykdl
```

### Key Contents of Starter Code

#### ``pf.py``

This file has skeleton of your particle filter (you don't have to build on this if you don't want to).  Check the comments in the file for more details.  This file has pretty much all of the interactions with ROS handled.  You should choose this option if you want to focus on implementing the particle filter algorithm  while minimizing wrangling with ROS infrastructure (you will still have some wrangling no doubt).

> You can also reimplement ``pf.py`` from scratch (or maybe using the starter code as a guide)

#### ``helper_functions.py``

This file has helper functions for dealing with transforms and poses in ROS. Functionality includes converting poses between various formats, computing the ``map`` to ``odom`` transform, and computing angle differences. 

#### ``occupancy_field.py``

This file implements something called an occupancy field (also called a likelihood field).  This structure has the following capability: given a x,y coordinate in the map, it returns the distance to the closest obstacle in the map.  This can be used as a way to compute the closeness of the match the scan data and the map given a hypothesized location of the robot (particle).

You can find an explanation of the likelihood field model in [Pieter Abbeel's slides](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa12/slides/ScanMatching.pdf) (start at page 11).

## A View of the Finish Line and Getting Set with RViz

Before diving into this project, it helps to have a sense of how a successful implementation of the particle filter functions.  You will be creating a map using ROS's built-in mapping system (which you will not be reimplementing) and testing ROS's built-in particle filter (which you will be reimplementing) on the data you collect.  To get started, run the following command.

> Note: we recommend running this with the simulator, but you can try on the real robot.  To do so, you would need to change the part where you start the simulator with connecting to an actual Neato.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 launch neato2_gazebo neato_gauntlet_world.py
```

Next, start the mapping program.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_sync_launch.py
```

Startup ``rviz2``.  You should see all the typical things, but now add a visualization of the ``map`` topic by clicking ``add`` going to the ``by topic`` dialogue and selecting ``map``.

If all went well you will see something like the following.

![An occupancy grid map](../website_graphics/rviz_mapping.png)

The representation of the map you see above is called an occupancy grid. The light gray spaces are mapped free space (no obstacle), the black squraes are mapped obstacles, and the dark gray space is unknown.  Drive around for a while until you are able to fill in the dark gray regions.

![An occupancy grid map that has been completely explored](../website_graphics/rviz_mapping_complete.png)

You can now save the map using the following command (replace ``map_name`` with whatever you want to call the map).

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```
ros2 service call /slam_toolbox/save_map slam_toolbox/srv/SaveMap "name:
  data: 'map_name'"
```

Make sure you can find the ``.yaml`` file that was saved in the previous step.  Counterintuitively, the map is saved based on the directory you were in when you launched the ``slam_toolbox``.

### Running AMCL

Now that you have a map, you will use the built-in particle filter package called AMCL (adaptive Monte Carlo localization).

Before you start this step here are a few things to do.
1.  Stop the ``slam_toolbox`` nodes you were running from before.  Find the terminal where you ran the ``slam_toolbox online_sync_launch.py`` command and hit ``control-c``.
2.  Make sure ``rviz`` is running and load the configuration under ``robot_localization/rviz/amcl.rviz`` (this will greatly simplify the visualization of the topics).  You can use the following shortcut to make sure the configuration is loaded (note: you would have to modify this a bit if your repo is in a different location).  ``rviz2 -d ~/ros2_ws/src/robot_localization/rviz/amcl.rviz``
3.  Make sure you know the path to the ``.yaml`` file created when you called the ros service ``save_map``.  Counterintuitively, the map is saved based on the directory you were in when you launched the ``slam_toolbox``.  Hopefully, that information will help you locate the ``.yaml`` file.  NOTE: when you use this path in the step below, you will need to replace the ``~`` character with the actual path to your home directory, e.g., ``/home/vpreston``.

To start ``AMCL``, run the following launch file.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 launch robot_localization test_amcl.py map_yaml:=path-to-your-yaml-file
```

Make sure to replace ``path-to-your-yaml-file`` with the path you determined in step (3) of the checklist above.

Once you execute this step, if everything went well you should see output like the following.

```

The last line where ``AMCL`` is complaining about wanting an initial pose, brings us to our next step.  Go to ``rviz2`` (make sure you loading the ``.rviz`` configuration specified above) and set an initial location for the particle filter using the ``2D Pose Estimate Widget``.  Click the location in the map where you think the robot is and drag in the direction you think the robot is facing.   Once you release the mouse, the visualizations of your robot and your LIDAR should return.  You should also see a bunch of red arrows indicating the particle locations.  Drive around for a while and see if the AMCL is able to converge to the correct robot pose.  How do you know if it is correct or not?  Here is an example of how it might look (note: despite my best efforts, I picked a bad initial position for AMCL.  Despite this, it was able to eventually figure out where the robot was).

![A video showing setup of amcl for the simulated Neato](../website_graphics/amcl.gif)

### Localizing a Robot

Return to the terminal where the rosbag is playing and click space bar.  Return to rviz.  You should see a cloud of particle in the map that move around with the motion of the robot.  If you want the particle filter to work well, you can update the 2D pose estimate based on the arrow shown by the ``map_pose`` topic.  If all goes well, you'll see the robot moving around in the map and the cloud of particles condensing to the true pose of the robot.



## Running your own Particle Filter

The instructions for running your particle filter are identical except for you need to use a different launch file to startup your code.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 launch robot_localization test_pf.py map_yaml:=path-to-your-yaml-file
```



## Localization with Bag Files

We have included some bag files in the repository that you can use to work on the project.  The bag files included are in the following locations. These bag files have been collected from the [Turtlebot4](https://clearpathrobotics.com/turtlebot-4/) several years ago.


```bash
robot_localization/bags/macfirst_floor_take_1
robot_localization/bags/macfirst_floor_take_2
```

Each bag file corresponds to the map.
```bash
robot_localization/maps/mac_1st_floor_final.yaml
```

> Note: before doing this, make sure Gazebo is shutdown and you are not connected to a physical robot (remember, the bag file will be supplying the sensor data)

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 bag play path-to-your-bag-file --clock 
```

In order to test your particle filter (``pf.py``) with a bag file, you can start up the particle filter as before.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 launch robot_localization test_pf.py map_yaml:=path-to-your-yaml-file
```

> Note 1: You'll see that we are instructing our code to avoid using the simulator time (since this data is from a real robot).
> Note 2: Currently, I am not able to make the bag files work with the built-in particle filter.  This is not a big deal since we are coding our own, but it's worth noting.

The setup for rviz is pretty involved, so we have provided a configuraion file for you.  Once rviz is open, you can click ``File`` then ``Open Config`` and the select ``~/ros2_ws/src/robot_localization/rviz/turtlebot_bag_files.rviz``.

Alternatively, you can launch ``rviz2`` and pass the configuration file on the command line.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
rviz2 -d ~/ros2_ws/src/robot_localization/rviz/turtlebot_bag_files.rviz
```

As with testing live, you will need to set an initial pose with the ``2D Pose Estimate`` in rviz.  As the bag plays you will see the robot move around in the map in rviz.  If your particle filter has localized your robot properly, the laser scans will line up with the features of the map.

When the bag is finished playing, you will probably want to perform the following steps to try another run of the particle filter.

1.  Reset rviz by clicking the ``reset`` button.
2.  Restart your particle filter by launching ``test_pf.py``.
3.  Restart the bag file via ``ros2 bag play``.

#### Recording your own bag files

You can make your own bag files either with the physical robot or the simulator.  When recording a bag file of the Neato, you'll want to modify your recording command a bit from what you did in the RoboBehaviors project.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```bash
ros2 bag record /accel /bump /odom /cmd_vel /scan /robot_description /stable_scan /projected_stable_scan /clock /tf /tf_static -o bag-file-name-here
```

## Choosing Your Own Adventure and Going Beyond
You have complete latitude for choosing your approach to particle filtering. While we've provided some skeleton code and reference AMCL in this project, there are many other particle-filtering or state-estimation techniques that you can examine. We highly recommend searching Google Scholar, StackOverflow, or the ROS2 Forums for some inspiration; you might also consider:
* How you might modify or expand upon one key step of the particle filter to enhance speed, memory, or robustness (e.g., hierarchical sampling, adaptive particle counts, partial-map references, etc.).
* Experimenting with "ambiguous scenarios" or different initialization schemes.
* Experimenting with different quality of laser data (adding noise to simulated inputs, using the vehicle, etc.) and analyzing uncertainty in your filter.
* Implementing different filtering techniques, based on optimization schemes (e.g., Kalman Filtering, Extended Kalman Filtering, etc.).
* Considering how different robot behaviors may impact localization quality.
* Attempting to implement a bare-bones SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) pipeline (or running an open-source technique and comparing it to your localization-only technique).

## Project Advice

### Instructor Advice

* Use the provided rosbags to debug your code (or, for practice, make your own ROS bags) 
* Visualize as many intermediate computations as possible
* Implement your unit tests as soon as possible and use these as part of your debugging workflow
* Start with simple cases, e.g. start with just one particle, make sure you can visualize the particle in rviz
	* Build test cases that can be used to assess that snippets/functions of your code are working as expected. You can use a bag-file you collect within a test case as well.
* Implement a simple laser scan likelihood function. Test it using just a subset of the Lidar measurements. Make sure that the results conform to what you expect (the simulator or rosbag will be helpful here).
* Improve your laser scan likelihood to maximize performance. Again, rosbag and visualization will be instrumental here.

### Previous Student Advice

Here is some advice from the Fall 2018 class that they wrote up after they completed the robot localization project.

* Pixels vs meters on map (know how these relate to each other)
* Know how coordinate frames relate to one another on rviz displays
* Know what the different rviz topics represent
* Probabilistic justification for parameters (and then cube it for good measure)
* High level understanding (videos) were helpful +1 +1
* Visualization in rviz is crucial
* First pass architecture (should be evaluated / given feedback) (note: this is more of a suggestion for the teaching team than you all).
* Maybe should have done a “ugly, rugged thing” would have helped to get an MVP. Maybe a more iterative process rather than strict planning. All the objects we created were hard to glue together.
* Take a “second pass” at the architecture after attempting to implement your first one. Take a step back and ask what you would do differently after having grappled with the low-level code for a week.
* Test each step of the particle filter separately, with full rviz visualizations, with single particles. Create a testing plan!
* Creativity in the weighting algorithm was nice since the x/y distance helper function just worked
* Rosbags are wonderful, wonderful things +1000
* Possibly some more scaffold around researching what amcl does and pull from it to test each part of the filter
