# WORK IN PROGRESS! CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES!


## Today

* Broader Impacts Phase 2 Discussions
* Image Segmentation Basics (For Your Consideration)
* Studio Time

## For Next Time
* Turn in your materials from the [Broader Impacts assignment Part 2](../assignments/broader_impacts), due on **November 4th at 7PM** 
* Work on the [Machine Vision Project Document](../assignments/computer_vision_project).
    * Project Shareouts will be **Monday November 10th in class**
    * Project Materials are due on **Tuesday November 11th at 7PM**
* Consider whether there is [feedback you'd like to share about the class](https://forms.gle/giCwA1pkr4y3e4T37)

## Broader Impacts Discussions
Today, we will be in small (~3 person) [discussion groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NA9mfE49KUpMjtrE3YvgMl1GpraCkPCOcifv5kFPIfE/edit?usp=sharing) for our Phase 2 assignment. A [reaction survey](https://forms.gle/3wD9fUtcbWWgd6F19) is provided to capture notes and reflections following each guided discussion.

> Discussants: Please choose a table / area of the room or the room next door for your discussion. A discussion slot will be ~15 minutes in length total, with 5-8 minutes for your prepared presentation and 7-10 minutes for discussion. It will be your responsibility to pace your discussion. Following your discussion, participants will have ~5 minutes to fill in a response survey; you are welcome to fill in one of these for yourself (please indicate in the form) if there are reflections you also want to capture.

> Participants: At the end of each discussion slot, please fill in [this reaction survey](https://forms.gle/3wD9fUtcbWWgd6F19). Your responses will be available to the teaching team and to discussants afterwards.

For all participants, do remember our shared norms for discussion:

* Aim to understand a novel or different perspective from one's own; disagreement is natural
* Practice open-mindedness
* Allow for provoking questions to deepen a conversation
* Consider the "gray areas" of many topics when discussing
* Respect differences of opinion, but challenge statements of fact
* Let people finish their thoughts, and let people speak
* Focus on discussion, rather than persuasion/debate

We'll have a brief debrief following the activity and before starting in on Studio time.

## Image Segmentation Basics (For Your Consideration)
During this unit we've been discussing classical methods for parsing images and extracting keypoints, creating descriptors, and performing the correspondence task. For your consideration today, here is a brief set of materials which cover the concept of _image segmentation_, which encompasses a variety of techniques with the goal of subdividing an image into regions.

Image segmentation techniques are commonly separated into three groups:
* **Instance Segmentation**: each pixel is assigned a "belonging instance" (e.g., every pedestrian in an image is separately sorted)
* **Semantic Segmentation**: each pixel is assigned a "belonging class" (e.g., a landscape is divided into sand, rock, tree, grass, sky, cloud, etc.)
* **Panoptic Segmentation**: each pixel is assigned a "belonging class" and individual instances of a class are further identified.

Each technique yields a slightly different output, which is important to consider when thinking about what downstream work you would like to do. For instance, in an object tracking scenario, being able to distinguish different types of objects, and identify a specific instance, may be important. Alternatively, in simple mapping, it may be enough to know the mixture of classes of objects in an environment.

Like everything in machine vision, there are classical and learned techniques that can be adopted to perform image segmentation.

### Classical Techniques
These classical techniques for image segmentation will likely look familiar to you -- they often leverage the same processes that we've been using to identify keypoints!

**Thresholding and Clustering** Using simple thresholding values on an image, we can isolate regions that "look similar" and assign them to various classes (by simply keeping track of what pixels meet certain criteria). Histogram methods are a variation on this technique. Enhancing this idea, we can process an image using a clustering algorithm, for instance, [K-Means Clustering](https://www.ibm.com/topics/k-means-clustering), to assign pixels to classes.

**Edge and Contour Detection** You can sort edges in an image (detected using gradient based methods that we might apply when looking for keypoints...) in order to assist with image segmentation. Hough transforms (for lines and for circles) look at edges and use a set of criteria to determine whether a set of edges are geometric matches to a target geometry. 

**Getting Advanced** Methods like variational partitioning, topic modeling, Markov random fields, and parameteric partial-differential equations, have all been adopted for processing images and extracting regions of interest. [The Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) on Image Segmentation gives a nice overview of each of these in turn.

### Learning / AI Techniques
Often, we want to segment an image, it is because there are particular "things" we're hoping to find. Learning-based techniques have really opened the door for advanced image segmentation that allows us to select for certain objects that may be challenging to heuristically select for using classical techniques (for instance, pedestrians in a busy street scene, objects in a cluttered kitchen, or specific types of animals in an environment we're monitoring).

[MathWorks has a nice explainer](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/image-video-processing/semantic-segmentation.html) on semantic segmentation that is absolutely worth a read, including how you can use their toolboxes to performed learned segmentation.

Learned segmentation models often make use of _convolutional neural networks_ (CNNs). If you'd like to learn more about specific architectures, [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/semantic-segmentation) is an excellent resource for papers + repositories + datasets you can run.
